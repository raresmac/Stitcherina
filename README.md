### Why you'll love Stitcherina:

*   **Interactive Pixel Editor ✏️**
    Found a pixel that doesn't look right? Click the preview to open the built-in editor! Use the **Pencil** tool to paint individual stitches or the **Bucket** tool to recolor every instance of a thread color globally.

*   **Precision Zoom 🔍**
    Get up close and personal with your design. Our new zoom system lets you scale your canvas from **0.1x all the way to 8x**, ensuring you never miss a single detail.

*   **Magic Pixelation ✨**
    Upload any photo and watch it transform into a perfect grid. If you upload existing pixel art, we’ll keep it crisp and preserve the original quality without any distortion.
    
*   **Smart Palette & Color Merging 🎨**
    Too many shades of red? Use the **Color Merge** slider to gently simplify your thread list. After editing, Stitcherina automatically cleans up your palette, removing any unused colors.

*   **Two Ways to Stitch 🧶**
    *   **Tapestry Mode:** Perfect for those who weave back and forth (Left-to-Right then Right-to-Left).
    *   **Cross-Stitch Mode:** For a classic, consistent Left-to-Right journey.

*   **Never Lose Your Spot 📍**
    Click on individual color blocks to mark them as "stitched," or check off entire rows. Row progress is automatically tracked as you click!

*   **Save & Resume 💾**
    Export your entire project (including progress and edits) as a tiny `.json` file, or save a high-quality **PNG image** of your pattern to share or print.
